# KourtneyK-Quiz-Project
The title of this project is KourtneyK-Quiz-Project. The reason why this project is so important is because it will showcase my knowledge of Javascript to prospective employers.

HOW IT WORKS: When the user enters the program, they are presented with an option to click 'start' and a timer counting down from 120 seconds.

After hitting 'start', the user will be presented with the first question:

If the user clicks the correct answer, they will be presented with an alert 'correct' and their score will go up by 1 point.

If the user clicks the incorrect answer, they will be presented with an alert 'incorrect' and their score will not change.

The user will then need to click the 'next' button to be presented with the next 2 questions:

The user can get a total of 3 points if all of the questions are answered correctly.

Once all of the questions have been answered, the next button will no longer allow the user to go to the next page and the user will then need to submit their quiz in order to be greeted with the final page.

Once on the final page, the user will need to submit their initials. Once the initials are submitted, the page will generate a list with the initial and game score to view.
